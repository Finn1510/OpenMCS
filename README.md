An Open Source tool to listen to music together with friends.
OpenMCS is short for Open music synchronizer. 
It synchronizes your music libruary with the libruary of your friend.
Just put your mp3 files in the music folder, connect to your friend or let your friend connect to you 
and enjoy listening to music together.
This is an Open source project and it will evolve over time.
